// Stretch 1: Try to arrange the following items from smallest to largest:
var sortingNumbers = [2, 5, 98, 55, 77, 300]
// Explain why it doesn't sort as expected.


// Stretch 2: Transform array1 into array2 using as few lines of code as you can without directly changing the value of an item (ie array1[0] = item)
var array1 = [2, 'dog', 34, 'Bill', 'plant', 'mug', 17];
// Goal:
var array2 = ['plant', 17, 2, 'Bill', 'dog'];

// Stretch 3: Transform array1 into array2 using as few lines of code as possible

var array1 = ['eight', 7, 'laptop', 'James', 2]
//Goal :
var array2 = ['eight', 'Your Name', 'James', 2]

// Stretch 4: Turn the follwing array into a sentence string
var array1 = ['The','quick','brown','fox','jumped','over','the','lazy','dog'];
//Goal
var string = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'
